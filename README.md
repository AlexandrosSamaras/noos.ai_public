Stop Guessing, Start Knowing: Understand Text Sentiment Instantly with NoosAI

Ever read an email, comment, or article and wondered about the real feeling behind the words? Misinterpreting tone can lead to confusion and missed opportunities. NoosAI puts the power of advanced AI sentiment analysis right into your Chrome browser, eliminating the guesswork.

Powered by Google's cutting-edge Gemini model via our secure cloud backend, NoosAI allows you to instantly analyze the sentiment of any text you select on virtually any webpage.

How It Works is Simple:

Select Text: Highlight any text snippet you want to understand better.
Instant Analysis: A clean, unobtrusive tooltip immediately appears, revealing the sentiment.
Gain Insight: Effortlessly grasp the emotional tone (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) along with the AI's confidence level.
Key Features:

📊 Accurate Sentiment Analysis: Classifies text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using Google Gemini.
🎯 Confidence Scores: See how confident the AI is in its analysis with clear percentage scores (e.g., Positive 95%), adding valuable nuance.
🌐 Analyze Anywhere: Works seamlessly on news sites, social media feeds, emails (like Gmail), PDFs opened in Chrome, customer reviews, forums, research papers, and more!
⚡ Instant & Effortless: Get insights with a simple highlight – no need to copy, paste, or switch to another application. Stay focused on your reading.
🎨 Clear Visual Feedback: Tooltips are intuitively color-coded (e.g., cool tones for Positive, warmer tones for Negative) and feature subtle fade animations.
⚙️ Customizable Experience:
Easily toggle the entire extension On/Off via the popup.
Enable or disable optional visual feedback animations (like a screen shake for strong negative sentiment) directly in the popup settings.
🔒 Secure & Private: Your privacy is paramount. Selected text is sent securely (HTTPS) to our dedicated backend service (hosted on Google Cloud Run) which then communicates with the Google Gemini API. We do not store the content of the text you analyze on our servers after the analysis is complete. Your API key (if required for future premium tiers involving user-provided keys) is handled securely server-side.
