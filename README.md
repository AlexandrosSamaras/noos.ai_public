NoosAI v2.0: Understand Text Like Never Before! üöÄ
We're thrilled to announce the launch of NoosAI v2.0! This major update brings a suite of powerful new AI-driven tools to your fingertips, designed to help you comprehend and interact with text more effectively. We've also revamped the interface for a smoother experience and squashed some bugs for enhanced stability.

‚ú® What's New in v2.0:
üß† Explain This: Select any text on a webpage, right-click, and choose "NoosAI: Explain Selection" (or use the "Explain" button in the popup with custom text). Get clear, concise explanations of complex topics, jargon, or difficult passages, helping you grasp concepts faster.
üí° Simplify This: Struggling with dense or overly academic text? Use the "NoosAI: Simplify Selection" context menu option or the "Simplify" button in the popup. NoosAI will rephrase the selected text into simpler, easier-to-understand language, making content more accessible.
üîç AI Search Selection: Got a question about a specific term or phrase you've selected? Right-click and select "NoosAI: AI Search Selection" (or use the "AI Search" button in the popup). Get quick, informative answers and summaries directly related to your selection, powered by advanced AI.
üåê Translate Summary In-Panel: After generating a summary, you can now translate it directly within the NoosAI results panel! Simply choose your desired language from the new dropdown and click "Translate Summary."
üöÄ Enhancements & UI Improvements:
Revamped Popup Interface:
The new "AI Search," "Explain," and "Simplify" buttons are now prominently featured at the top of the custom analysis section.
The "Summarize Page" button has been removed from the popup to streamline the interface (you can still summarize pages via the context menu).
Animation settings have been moved to the extension's Options page, decluttering the main popup.
The "Options" link has been removed from the popup for a cleaner look.
Draggable Results Panel: The NoosAI results panel that appears on your page is now draggable! Easily move it around to your preferred position on the screen.
Improved Language Consistency: We've refined our AI prompting, especially when "auto" language detection is used. Explanations, simplifications, and AI search results should now more reliably match the predominant language of your source text.
Clearer In-Panel Feedback: Error messages and status updates (like "Premium feature requires upgrade" or "Free tier limit reached") are now more specific and clearly displayed within the results panel.
Context Menu Reordering: The order of actions in the right-click context menu has been updated to better align with the new button layout in the popup, providing a more consistent experience.
üîß Bug Fixes & Stability:
General stability improvements and fixes to ensure smoother operation across various websites.
Resolved issues with UI elements not updating correctly after certain actions.
Improved error handling for backend communication.
We're excited for you to try out these new capabilities! Update your NoosAI extension to v2.0 now and take your text comprehension to the next level. As always, we welcome your feedback to help us continue improving.

Happy Analyzing! The NoosAI Team
